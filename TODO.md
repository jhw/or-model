### thoughts

- ability to constrain ratings?
  - not sure it's worth it
- remove sources dependency?
  - not sure it's worth it

### done

- script to parse FD for AH, OU data
- remove fd key
- why doesn't fd scraper seem to be returning all events?
- expected points calculation
- fix stdev field
- poisson_solver disappointing results :(
- format existing solver results vs new scipy solver
- replace solver with scipy optimise [notes]
- add mean, sd training set errors to teams
- training set isn't cutting off properly at 6 teams
- add deductions
- return table.values()
- refactor api output
- remove seed
- allow drift multiplier to be part of output

- leagues
- pass leaguename to test.py
- better directory structure
- better interfaces
- setup.py
- get simulator test to work
- abstract kernel
